Despite a century of peace between our two nations, past transgressions have not been forgotten and both sides have been involved in a tug of war spanning from Azerbaijan in the North to Kasab in the South.\n\nWith the Sublime Porte, until recently the definitive power in the Middle East, struggling on all sides and tangling finances, military affairs, pacifism and foreign policy, the time has come for a resurgent Iran to test the limits of Ottoman power and restore the might of Teheran over not only the Gulf but also Iraq and Eastern Anatolia."

As such deviating their attention further North, the Gulf will see itself open to Iranian incursions. "

Singlehandedly having the capacity to completely cut off the strait of Hormuz, thus cutting Iran and Iraq off from the world's economy, it has been a thorn in the sight of both Konstantiniyye and Teheran. With Muscat however forming a neutral power between the two rivalling blocs, an acceptable compromise seem to have been reached and for centuries the Sultans of the Muscati thalassocracy have been able to govern the peninsula uncontested.\n\nThe decay of the Muscati state has however not gone unnoticed and with tensions rising between the two largest powers in the region, the peninsula has found itself a pawn in a dangerous game. The Muscati navy, their lifeblood and pride for centuries, has been entirely wiped out as the industrial behemoths of the seas have outclassed the classical Dhows leaving the defence of the peninsula solely to the goodwill of its neighbours. This goodwill seems to have run out as naval maneuvres by the Persian fleet around the Strait have led to a similar response from the Caliphate, bringing the two to the brink of war."
