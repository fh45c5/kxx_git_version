 LEP_the_marshal_stands_triumphant: "联帅大获全胜"
 LEP_the_marshal_stands_triumphant_desc: "The uppity fools following Governor Chen and the damnable spirits of the Kuomintang thought they could supercede the League! Yet we have undeniably put them back in their place! With the formal ascension of Qi Xieyuan to the role of League Marshal following Sun's truly tragic death, the duty falls upon us to continue the plans of the \"Smiling Tiger\"."
 LEP_two_marshals_under_the_sky: "天下可容两帅"
 LEP_two_marshals_under_the_sky_desc: "Sun Chuanfang found himself in an odd situation. Ostensibly the Jade Marshal's protege, he was in no way his formally accepted successor. Too estranged, distrusted by the rest of the Northern Zhili. No matter! Qi Xieyuan is an elusive chameleon! Together, the Jade Marshal and the League Marshal shall restore order to the Middle Kingdom, and assert the Zhili's dominance!"
 LEP_deepen_the_zhili_schism: "加深直系分裂"
 LEP_deepen_the_zhili_schism_desc: "The perfidious Northern Zhili think of their Southern brethren as nothing more but upstarts, the outer rung, inconsequential! Utilising us as pawns for their own game, they'd be so deeply misunderstood. Sun Chuanfang left with us the legitimacy to fulfill a vision, to be the true heirs to the legacy of Beiyang. Controlling the Southern Capital, we shall march onwards!"
 LEP_joint_training_with_beijing: "与北京联合训练"
 LEP_joint_training_with_beijing_desc: "Truly many of our commanders could learn a large deal of military knowledge and expertise from our Northern counterparts. For our measly Jinling Academy holds nothing but a candle to the legendary Baoding Military Academy. Even on a personal basis, many of our top commanders lack formal military tutorship. Through the conduction of joint exercises, the Zhili is sure to cement itself."
 LEP_negotiate_with_the_nationalistic_elite: "与民族主义精英谈判"
 LEP_negotiate_with_the_nationalistic_elite_desc: "The noble Democracy and Science Forum are a grouping of liberal, nationalist and progressive intellectuals residing within Shanghai and Beijing. Who remain at true disdain with the authoritarian nature of Zhili-ruled provinces within the nation. Mutually distasteful, it is nonetheless the prudent move to bring these men of words to the negotiation table to paint a veneer of genuine intention."
 LEP_utilize_the_jingxing_society: "利用景星会"
 LEP_utilize_the_jingxing_society_desc: "One of perhaps the most curious intellectuals within Nanjing's retinue is that of the young, boisterous and witty Li Linsi. Carrying with him the Jingxing Society, they are an interest group of intellectuals and civilians far more tolerant of the Zhili, and in return, supportive of a deepening of pro-German relations. Spurned by most but not all, their support could prove invaluable in the schemes to come."
 LEP_foster_economic_cooperation: "促进经济合作"
 LEP_foster_economic_cooperation_desc: "One of the greatest benefits of extensive German investment and development within the League's territories is that of the resounding economic power projection potential that the League exhibits. However there is great disparity, as for every Zhejiang there is a Fujian. By cooperating with Beijing and integrating our economies further, perhaps we will have our own Golden Waterway."
 LEP_end_southern_intransigence: "消灭南方强硬分子"
 LEP_end_southern_intransigence_desc: "In perhaps the League's most clouded moment, in our darkest hour, the Governors of Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi finally cut ties. Having long been distancing themselves ever since their informal incorporation, the Southerners would find themselves positioned to strike against our own domain in the future. To preserve our legacy, we must be swifter than them!"
 LEP_secure_german_support: "确保德国支持"
 LEP_secure_german_support_desc: "Our loving allies, our true friends! Without the Germans the League would be all but a dependency on the machinations within Beijing. For our grand ambitions, we necessitate even grander support. Through our connections established prior, let us increase the amount of German aid for our recovering economy and army. In return, we secure for them their influence within china."
 LEP_heir_to_the_jade_marshal: "玉帅接班人"
 LEP_heir_to_the_jade_marshal_desc: "Truly it is the Southern Zhili that are the successors to the machinations of the Jade Marshal! Once it was Sun Chuanfang, and perhaps Marshal Wu has his own ideas like the weak Bai Jianwu, but without the glorious League Marshal Qi Xieyuan, the Zhili would have very well met their doom at the hands of the Kuomintang, or Fengtian. Even Wu knows this, and surely Beijing must grant us the respect we deserve."
 LEP_last_son_of_the_family: "单传继嗣"
 LEP_last_son_of_the_family_desc: "The Northern Zhili have cast away any pretenses they had to the cause of Feng Guozhang! To have cut every branch of the patronage network besides their own! It is not Wu, Cao or Wang who are the heirs to Li Hongzhang however, it is the South! The true last heirs to the legacy of the Chinese Bismarck! With our ambitions ever greater, it is time to march north..."
 LEP_crack_down_rural_bandits: "镇压乡间土匪"
 LEP_crack_down_rural_bandits_desc: "Day in and day out, rural bandits, some having even been former soldiers, continue to terrorise our citizens and officials. Numbered by scoundrels such as the Red Spears and Yiguandao, they continue to stir up trouble. We must begin a formal crackdown on these troubledoers similar to that of the encirclement campaigns, if we are to cripple their movement."
 LEP_fallout_of_the_league_war: "华东混战的余波"
 LEP_fallout_of_the_league_war_desc: "谢天谢地，联合最黑暗的时刻终于过去了。纵使那该死的暴发户、桀骏不驯的陈督理认为自己可趁此一举击败联帅，以及那南方的国民革命军残部亦认定此为其最后的机会。然而联合得以度过风暴。而现在，是重建的时间了。"
 LEP_reinstill_discipline: "重拾“纪律”"
 LEP_reinstill_discipline_desc: "随着在联合内部失去任何表面上的权威，很明显，若无笑面虎的机智、关系和德高望重，各省军只不过是些自私自利的流氓。由于华东混战大抵是我们迄今为止最糟的一次表现，联帅必须巩固他作为各省军最高指挥官之权威。"
 LEP_recoup_the_lost_divisions: "重整残师"
 LEP_recoup_the_lost_divisions_desc: "于联合崩溃期间，因为陈督理那影响深远的叛乱，一些旧联合部队也随之叛逃。由于我军一些部队已投奔皖军，甚至是国民党，我军各阶官兵编制皆出现了不少空缺。为重建联合，必先重建军队。"
 LEP_eliteheer_model: "精兵模范"
 LEP_eliteheer_model_desc: "Most fortunate and prudent for the League Armies, we were the true testing grounds for the German Military Mission and all of its benefits. Extensively cooperating with the German advisors, as opposed to the interference ran by Wu Peifu or the middling scraps that Hunan and Liangguang received, the true birthplace of the Eliteheer is within Nanjing! Not Beijing!"
 LEP_new_model_officer: "新模范军官"
 LEP_new_model_officer_desc: "Germany's officer corps are by far the most supreme in the world. To have won their most fantastic victory in the Great War, the Heer could not have conducted itself without an extensive staff of capable officers supplementing every plan. Reconstituting the German advisory mission, we must exhalt the role of the junior \"New Model Officer\" if we are to triumph on the battlefield."
 LEP_innovation_breeds_victory: "出新制胜"
 LEP_innovation_breeds_victory_desc: "Modern tanks, modern planes, modern ships, modern guns, those are the key to Germany's dominance in the international battleground. Similarly, the Chinese Armies, particularly lacking in the cutting-edge of equipment, should modernise. And such actions should be conducted rapidly without halting. To turn the tides of conflict, one must proliferate rapid development in the modern arms race."
 LEP_staff_officer_school: "参谋学校"
 LEP_staff_officer_school_desc: "Generals and soldiers cannot achieve victory singelhandedly, for the intermediary, the officer corps and the local commanders are those that charge forward in battle. Coordinating the conduct of warfare on the ground, they must follow through with an overall strategic objective, whilst tactical plans are best left in their hands.Training our officers to pursue local autonomy in command will ensure the League is never paralysed by indecision."
 LEP_thorough_logistics: "依靠后勤"
 LEP_thorough_logistics_desc: "Often most forgotten about in the grandstanding of sweeping strategical manouvers and the daring implementation of local tactics is that of the desk job. The staff officer, the men who ensure that our brave soldiers all carry guns in their hands, with ammunition to boot. China's nascent logistical infrastructure lacks the development of Europe, true. But the League shall be the first to implement modern logistical methods."
 LEP_disrupting_supply: "袭扰补给线"
 LEP_disrupting_supply_desc: "Similarly, with the knowledge allowing us to understand the integrity of supply, it is imperative that we ensure the enemy's supply lines are as fragile, tenuous, or transparent as possible. For a battle may be won by the tenacity of its soldiers and brilliance of its commanders, but a war is won by an army's capacity to maintain its momentum."
 LEP_overtures_to_berlin: "示好柏林"
 LEP_overtures_to_berlin_desc: "Conducting the reconstruction of the League's army under the plans laid out by the original 80 Division Plan, perhaps it is time to finally reconstitute the German Advisory Mission? To truly emulate that of the victorious Heer, we necessitate the experience and wisdom of its humble servants and warriors. Utilising our ties with the Jixing Society, let us send an olive branch to Berlin."
 LEP_raining_thunder: "雷霆万钧"
 LEP_raining_thunder_desc: "Artillery is the king of warfare. The Germans proved that, and the warfare commonly experienced within the Central Plains and that of the coastline is dominated by the size of the cannon. Any force with the larger gun, the more accurate operator, and the skilled commander is sure to secure absolute victory. With the experience of our German advisors, our industry shall maximise production efficiency of artillery."
 LEP_emphasising_mobility: "强调机动性"
 LEP_emphasising_mobility_desc: "All military theorists in the modern age, be it Chinese or European, understand the primacy and importance of mobile warfare. Allowing extravagant tactical manouvers, a meagre force can pincer and encircle a much larger force, rendering it hollow. Similarly, one can capture vast swathes of territory and elude destruction or disintegration by simply maintaining mobility."
 LEP_symphony_of_factory_and_firepower: "军工火力交响曲"
 LEP_symphony_of_factory_and_firepower_desc: "Espoused by German military theorists such as Max Bauer, and respected by most other factions within their ideological circles, the army and industrial sector must work in a beautiful symphony if they are to secure a common synergetic goal. By utilising our special business contacts with the AOG, and through the parley of the Jinxing Society, the military and industry shall work in complete unison."
 LEP_primacy_of_the_engineering_corps: "工兵队优先"
 LEP_primacy_of_the_engineering_corps_desc: "Who constructs the trenches? The fortifications? The forward operating bases? Without the Engineer Corps within our army, our soldiers would be without their defenses, merely sitting ducks for the enemy's hail of fire. Modern war necessitates a devout, strong and resilient group of willing military engineers to allow us to conduct advanced operations."
 LEP_shattering_their_walls: "摧坚破垒"
 LEP_shattering_their_walls_desc: "Our industry may be up to scratch in aiding our armies in fielding the most numerous amount of cannons in the Southeast, but what of their quality? To truly strike fear into our enemies, our volleys must not only be numerous, but devastating. Throught the drafting of a series of artillery shooting courses and other methods, we must drill our artillery commanders to rain hellfire upon our enemies."
 LEP_artillery_of_the_sky: "空中炮兵"
 LEP_artillery_of_the_sky_desc: "Many besmirch the Chinese air force, split between the efforts of regionalist warlords, many doubt the potential for even the Central Government to utilise modern aviation methods, or even to field modern planes. However, theorists such as Jiang Baili continue to push for the implementation of the \"Artillery of the Sky\". For the West has clearly displayed the magnificence of the third avenue of warfare."
 LEP_artillery_of_the_sea: "海上炮兵"
 LEP_artillery_of_the_sea_desc: "The legacy left to us by the Beiyang Fleet is an admirable one. Having totalled in the top ten navies of the world by tonnage and firepower at one point, the Beiyang Fleet was the iron wall of the ocean. Crippled and left for dead by the Sino-Japanese War, its modern rendition is meagre, and hardly worthy of the Chinese Nation. Utilising our immense industry, we shall rule the waves with undending steel once more!"
 LEP_fortifying_our_positions: "就地筑垒"
 LEP_fortifying_our_positions_desc: "As we peer to the horizon, all that we witness is encompassed by the Rising Sun's rays. If we are to withstand the onslaught, for it is truly inevitable, our offense must be multifaceted true, but we cannot let our defense fall behind. Constructing shields of concrete, mazes of trenches, we must provide an iron front, impossible to pierce."
 LEP_nanjing_air_academy: "南京航空学校"
 LEP_nanjing_air_academy_desc: "Perhaps most unfortunate is the Chinese air force's lack of coordination. Baoding has its own academy, Kunming similarly. Whampoa did, and the warlords inbetween exhibit their own rough implementation of air forces. Disgracefully, we must also coalesce all of Nanjing's native air academies, having spurned on such greats such as \"The Chinese Lindbergh\", into one institution. If we are to stand a chance in the future."
 LEP_cult_of_aviation: "航空崇拜"
 LEP_cult_of_aviation_desc: "Though our fighter aces cannot win the air war singlehandedly, they nonetheless serve as the adoring stars of the innovative third avenue of warfare. Utilising propaganda methods, we can exemplify these (usually young) soldiers as daring aces putting their lives on the line for the glory of the Chinese nation. Extolling heroism and bravery, this will promote tenacity within our pilot cadres."
 LEP_china_air_fleet: "中国的飞行队"
 LEP_china_air_fleet_desc: "For too long have the Chinese had to endure egregious contracts from Westerners and imperialists alike to only acquire a few meagre, outdated and utterly useless air frames. Granted, they still did the job superbly, mostly due to lack of strong opposition. However as the world encroaches upon China once more, only the most industrious regions can claim the true mantle of \"China's Native Air Fleet\"."
 LEP_through_fire_and_war: "烈火激战"
 LEP_through_fire_and_war_desc: "Be it through the mud, the blood, the fire or the steel, our soldiers shall charge forward forevermore. Unwavering, with sabre at hip and rifle in hand, our men must set themselves as the example of the true capacity of the Chinese soldier. There is no future in which we unite the Chinese nation without our warriors and there never will be! They cannot falter!"
 LEP_the_pinnacle_of_chinese_soldiery: "中国最优质的战士"
 LEP_the_pinnacle_of_chinese_soldiery_desc: "The true conclusion of the aspirations of the German Military Mission, to have constructed a new army worthy of being cemented in the annals of Chinese history alongside the likes of the Jingguojun, Anguojun or the Huguojun. Our soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! Our soldiers push forward! Our soldiers rage! Our soldiers fight!"
 LEP_rural_banditry: "乡间匪患"
 LEP_rural_banditry_desc: "各省的普遍动荡，加上各地的内战，在各地造成了严重的动荡。土匪开始武力对抗政府，其中不少人属于逼上梁山。现在他们正在聚集在一起，并在我们北部各省造成了极大的混乱。如果我们不迅速将其镇压，那么当地的秩序只会更加混乱。"
 LEP_joint_training_with_beijing_idea: "与中央军联合训练"
 LEP_joint_training_with_beijing_idea_desc: "Following a our re-admission into the broader Zhili family tree, League Marshal [LEP.GetLeader] has sought a mutual period of joint drills with Marshal Wu and Marshal Wang's Central Army. Hoping to oversee a period of modernisation, finishing what Sun Chuanfang started, Qi also desires to emulate the discipline of the Central Army, and to bring the rather unruly League Allied Armies to heel."
 LEP_open_door_policy_with_beijing: "对北京方面打开大门"
 LEP_open_door_policy_with_beijing_desc: "The Northern Zhili lands carry with them immense profits, with the industrial powerhouses of Hubei and Zhili province carrying some of the country's most economically productive cities. Similarly, the League retains within it Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang. If the Zhili clique is to stand the test of time, we must integrate our economies, welcoming businessmen from both sides."
 LEP_formenting_pro_german_intellectuals: "培养亲德知识分子"
 LEP_formenting_pro_german_intellectuals_desc: "That peculiar man, Li Linsi, carries with him quite a prominent intellectual circle within League circles. With ties to the likes of Wellington Koo in Beijing and other Assembly members, Li also has numerous connections to Berlin. By leaning on his Jinxing Society, we can further ingratiate ourselves with the Germans in exchange for further support."
 LEP_eight_provinces_allied_armies: "八省联军"
 LEP_eight_provinces_allied_armies_desc: "Born out of Sun Chuanfang's desire to unite the Southeast, the Eight Province Inter-Allied Armies owe their origins to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Allied Army, formed in 1924 in response to the outbreak of the Zhejiang-Jiangsu war of 1924. Formed by Governors Sun and Governors Qi, such an alliance would ultimately end with Qi's deposition from China. However Sun Chuanfang would remain, and slowly amass his power in the Southeast with Cao Kun and Wu Peifu's permission. Seizing Nanjing, and with control of Fujian and Zhejiang, Sun would negotiate with Fang Benren and Deng Ruzhuo to join his alliance, similarly conducting such matters with Chen Tiaoyuan. Fighting off a war with Fengtian and Zhang Zongchang, Sun would establish a five-province coalition system encompassing Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui and Jiangxi to formalise his alliance.\n\nWhilst the originaly governors of that time, Chen Taoyi, Xia Chao, Wang Pu, Li Dingkui and Sa Zhenbing are now on different paths from the League, Sun remained. Weathering the storm of the Northern Expedition, the now Eight Province (following the incorporation of Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi in 1928) Inter-Allied Armies are a highly decentralised bunch. With the three most recent provinces effectively maintaining their own armies, the Eastern provinces ostensibly maintain their forces under the League Marshal's auspices. Although Sun himself retains a personal force within Nanjing. Altogether they contribute to an almost modernised force capable of standing against the Central Army.\n\nAs long as Sun remains, the League Army will endure!"
 LEP_the_disunited_armies_1: "Disunity in the Coalition"
 LEP_the_disunited_armies_1_desc: "Catastrophe has struck the League of Eight Provinces! With unrest flooding all throughout the provincial territories following the AOG circumventing the League Marshal's authority, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan has officialised his formal secession from the League! Whilst a geopolitical nightmare, it has sent reverberations all throughout the Eight Province Inter-Allied Armies. Soldiers are mutinying, Governors in the West have refused to update Nanjing on their status, the Kuomintang have grown bolder, and the clouds are gathering on Nanjing. However, the Smiling Tiger still stands! And all traitors, large and small, will face the Tiger's fury. The League is safe, as long as he retains power."
 LEP_the_disunited_armies_2: "$LEP_the_disunited_armies_1$"
 LEP_the_disunited_armies_2_desc: "Perfidy! With Sun Chuanfang deposed, Qi Xieyuan has become the official successor to the role of Commander-in-Chief of the now Five Province Inter-Allied Armies. Lacking both Sun Chuanfang's charisma and military skill, Qi commands very little beyond his immediate soldiers as Governor of Jiangsu. With most of the Smiling Tiger's closest compatriots merely choosing to side with Qi for their own survival, considering the other option is most likely execution, the unity of the League's Army is fraught."
 LEP_the_disunited_armies_3: "$LEP_the_disunited_armies_1$"
 LEP_the_disunited_armies_3_desc: "Having reassured his closest \"compatriots\" of his \"genuine\" intent to restore the Southern Zhili and the League to greatness oncemore, League Marshal Qi Xieyuan has managed to somewhat calm tempers. With the coalition still fractured, its component parts are nonetheless working with the League Marshal not only for survival, but some are convinced that he will lead the League to greatness. Although, many still think of him as an unsavoury fellow..."
 LEP_eliteheer: "精兵之荣耀"
 LEP_eliteheer_desc: "Most obviously, our German benefactors have dominated the world through cautious wit, conniving diplomacy, and the supremacy of their soldiery. If we are to emulate even a crumb, in conjunction with our reconstituted German Military Advisors, we must entirely subsume ourselves to their way of thinking. The League Army has never been a truly weak force, that is true, for a majority of its commanders owe heritage to the intense training of Japanese military academies and that of Baoding. However for those who have engaged in nepotism and cronyism to find themselves in their commands, they prove an unmeasurable weakness.\n\nEstablishing a new League army, powerful enough to keep the warlords in check, foreign invvaders at bay, and spearhead modern military endeavours will be a titanic task to pursue. However there is no other polity capable than that of the League to ensure that China's armies march into the modern era."
 LEP_engineering_corps_1: "工兵队优先"
 LEP_engineering_corps_1_desc: "Often overlooked, the primacy of the Engineering Corps is all too prevalent and critical in the era of modern warfare. Their utilisation within Europe has managed to prevent total catastrophe, enable daring unforeseen strategic operations, and allowed continued relevance of infantry in the era of armoured behemoths. In the League's mission to bring modern industrial warfare to China, it is imperative that our engineers are up to the task of constructing whatever is necessary to maintain a battleground edge on our opponents."
 LEP_german_equipment_support_1: "军工协奏"
 LEP_german_equipment_support_1_desc: "To truly assert our dominance over our adversaries, be it warlords or foreign imperialists, the League Army must be able to fully mobilise all of its military might, and wage a total war of absolute submission. Through state planned development of heavy industry, communications, air transport, we shall spurn a truly modern army based on the German General Staff. Utilising contacts within the Legations and Berlin, we shall endeavour to attract foreign military industrial experts to aid in providing capital and assistance for our lofty ambitions. Transforming our meagre industry into that of a concert of firepower and thunder will ensure that another League Collapse will never happen again!"
 LEP_pinnacle_army: "五省联军"
 LEP_pinnacle_army_desc: "The Wusheng Lianjun, or United Army of the Five Provinces, is the true name of the League's inter-allied armies. Born from the magnificence of the Smiling Tiger a decade ago, each provincial Governor is the respective Commander-in-Chief of their province, commanding a vast swathe of subordinates. However, they all bow to the authority of the League Marshal as overall Commander of the joint forces. Numerous and in large quantity, the League Army still proved radically in-effective in light of the smaller National Revolutionary Army. Solders born from Whampoa were able to consistently trounce our much bigger forces, only being driven back by the German intervention.\n\nWith the extensive modernisation program conducted by the renewed German Advisory Mission, and the enacting of a period of serious reform, analysis, and reconstruction of the League Army of old, the new glorious United Army of the Five Provinces truly represents the peak of modernity and warrior spirit within the Chinese nation. Armed with German equipment, practicing mobile warfare tactics, with an elite core of stormtroopers, we have brought modern warfare to the Chinese battlefield, and the whole nation will acknowledge our symphony of industry and steel."
 LEP_nanjing_airforce_1: "中国空军的摇篮"
 LEP_nanjing_airforce_1_desc: "Originally the site of the Late Qing's 81st Cavalry Tearm and Artillery Battalion School Ground, League Marshal inundated Jiangqiao airport in 1930 as the birthplace of his League Airforce. Building an airstrip on the original campus site, he would officially move the Nanjing Air Academy here in 1931. Spouting facilities such as an airport, bomb depot, machine repair shop, and aircraft manufacturing plant, the western portion is dedicated to student and faculty amenites. Dubbed \"The Cradle of the Chinese Airforce\" by foreign observers due to having trained more than 500 students, it has received renewed attention following revived League Air Warfare efforts. With the League being one of the most industrialised entitities within the nation, it is undoubtedly the most suitable to be the progenitor of China's Air Power."
 LEP_nanjing_navy: "福建水师"
 LEP_nanjing_navy_desc: "The Legendary Fujian naval clique has a storied history. Born from China's desire to not fall behind in the technology arms race with the west, the Westernisation Movement spurned Governor Zuo Zongtang in 1866 to construct a series of shipyards in Fuzhou, Fujian. Choosing Mawei as the base to build its shipyard, a slow formenting and directing of Fujian's naval culture into the Chinese admiralty began to develop.\n\nSpecialising in a variety of schools, from manufacturing to driving to administration to design, the students would be taught by foreign advisors, and learn all facets of British naval doctrine and French shipbuilding. Being functionally the Cradle of the Chinese Navy, the Fujian Naval Academy was the first modern military academy, modern professional college and first naval navigation institution in modern China.\n\nHaving long persisted despite the destruction of the Fujian fleet in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, Fujian's naval clique has once again carried forth the flag of China's nascent naval power.
